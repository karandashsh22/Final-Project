-Corners: a corner can sometimes be construed as a special type of free-kick taken from the corner area. Generally speaking, the more corners, the more times the attacking team has forced the defending team to clear the ball so that it crosses the goal line of their own defending half, more details on the corner rule can be found at https://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/lawsandrules/laws/football-11-11/law-17---the-corner-kick

-Shot on target: according to online sources there are multiple definitions of what is a shot on target, but practically speaking one can think of a shot that would have hit the net if the goalkeeper or another player(usually a defender but not necessarily) did not block it, that basically include all shots that go within the frame of the goal. Note: a shot on the framework is not a shot on target unless it bounces into the net, please visit https://www.bigsoccer.com/threads/what-precisely-is-a-shot-on-goal.2028210/ for more details

-Penalty shoot-out: if the scoreline of a match cannot be settled within the regular 90 minutes of time plus 30 minutes of extra time (either in a one-leg game or in the second leg of a two-leg game) in the knock-out stage, it will be decided in a penalty shoot-out. One can think of the “tiebreak” in tennis, it is the ultimate way to decide a winner of the game that cannot be decided during regular time. Here, any game that goes to the penalty shoot-out will be marked as a draw (D), regardless of the eventual winner. Note: it can only happen in the knock-out stage of cup games(including the Community Shield, FA Cup EFL Cup, or UEFA Champions League knock-out stage), but not in any group stage or league games.

-offside: this is a fairly important yet somewhat hard-to-explain rule in soccer. In a nutshell, “offside” means a situation where the attacking player is behind the last defender in the attacking half when the ball is passed to him. A “goal” scored from an offside position will not count as a goal. More details at https://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/lawsandrules/laws/football-11-11/law-11---offside
